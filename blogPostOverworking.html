							<p>The world can seem like a rat race from the moment you are put in school till the moment you retire. Especially in TECH it can be daunting, because new technologies get created left and right while you still can't do a proper layout in CSS (foreshadowing haha). How do I deal with all of it?</p>
							<p>Quick answer: I don't. Long answer: I am more mindful then I've ever been before. I know that without resting, you can't go very far. I am not guilting myself over a day when I didn't code because I was on a day-long hike with my partner. There will always be someone who makes more money than me, someone who is more talented, someone who is just an idealistic version of me on social media. When it comes to social medias, I have a feed blocker on all of my socials apart from twitter and LinkedIn. I don't check my mail 10 times every minute, because I know that nothing is more important than a healthy attention span and low cortisol levels. Not everybody will respect my rules, but then I know who really cares about me/my work.</p>
							<p>Last section summerized external factors but what about internals? Yeah, this is the hard part. I am naturally an overachiever and it's difficult for me to just give up/stop doing something. Well, this is something that everybody has to keep track on. I've noticed throughout years of my work life/school that I work better when I rest. I know, a shocker haha. It was always easy for me to forget about exercising or eating healthy because "I have to finish this project". I would finish this one but on the next one my body would just give up. Long-term thinking about coding helps me to understand that this is is a skill you can master over years, not months.</p>
							<p>I know that nothing above was groundbreaking but it doesn't always have to be. It can be simple and if simple works for you then great. Obviously my perspective is very personal and I don't want to persuade you to follow in my footsteps. </p>
